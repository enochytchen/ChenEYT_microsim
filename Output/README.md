## Using this repository
The repository enables the reproduction of analyses from the study: Chen EYT, Dickman PW, Clements MS. A Multistate Model Incorporating Relative Survival Extrapolation and Mixed Time Scales for Health Technology Assessment. *PharmacoEconomics*. 2024. (doi:https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-024-01457-w). This work extends upon data and methodologies from Williams et al. (2017), whose supplementary materials informed portions of the analyses (available from: www.gla.ac.uk/hehta/reports/cwilliams).
